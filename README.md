## Motivation
>"You are under no obligation to be the same person you were five minutes ago"- *Alan Watts*  

This quote is the inspiration behind LevelUp. When I first heard this quote, I felt like I wasn't where I was supposed to be in life. This quote made me realize I had the power to change the trajectory of my life, which inspired me to start my self-growth journey. I wanted to build a website that would help others LevelUp their lives using the knowledge I've found through my self-growth journey.  

LevelUp allows you to set specific goals and check in on them regularly so that you can constantly see how you're progressing, a key factor in achieving goals. LevelUp also has a feature to help you break bad habits using the teachings from Charles Duhigg's "The Power Of Habit".
